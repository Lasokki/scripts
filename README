scripts
=======

Small scripts in various languages.

Catalogue:

-Bookmark (SML)
    CLI tool for bookmarking books. I mostly use this script to keep track of ebooks and pdfs.
    usage: ./bookmark "name of a book" <page number>
-Indiegogo-tracker (Python)
    Pulls balance of an Indiegogo-campaign and shows delta in balance
    usage: python indiegogo_tracker.py "http://URL" <seconds between checks>
-Note (Python)
    Writes timestamped notes to a file (notes.log)
    usage: python note.py "note"
