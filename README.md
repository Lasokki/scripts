scripts
=======

Small scripts in various languages.

Catalogue:

-Bookmark (SML)
  CLI tool for bookmarking books. I mostly use this script to keep track of ebooks or pdfs
  use: ./bookmark "name of a book or something" <page number>

-Indiegogo-tracker (Python)
  Pulls balance of an Indiegogo-campaign and shows delta in balance
  use: python indiegogo_tracker.py "http://URL" <seconds between checks>
